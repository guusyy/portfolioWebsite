## About

> Hi, my name is Guus Noij a designer and wanna be front-end developer currently living in Nijmegen.

You know, I started off as a designer not really knowing what I liked to do. I liked being creative but not only on paper. I liked thinking about ideas and formulating a concept.
Translating cool idea's into a technology scope is what I wake up to do. I often work together with artists to realise and make their idea's specific into code.
