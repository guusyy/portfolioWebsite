## About

> Hi, my name is Guus Noij a UX designer and Front-end developer living in Nijmegen.

I currently work as a UX designer for Planon Software in Nijmegen. Apart from my visual design tasks I also have a high interest in usefull front end development 
projects that increases the experience of the users. From my experience  there is often a gap between a design and an implementation. 
Designers and developers should work hand in hand to find the solutions that fit their design idea's and suit the specific user. 
Finding these solutions and realising them is what I like to do.
