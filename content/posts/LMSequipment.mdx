In each firedepartment the local brigade uses different tools for emergency situation.
Apart from using just water hose, the fire department also uses hydrolic and other rescue equipment.
For instance to elevate a large truck they use specialized Hybrid Bags.

To make the best decisions in emergency situations, firedepartments often need training for these tools.
There are all kind of combinations which tools are best to use in what situation.
Therefore they are in need for training, this app provides added e-learning material.
With this web app the fire departments can see the different effects the tools have.
For example see which weight is best lifted with what kind of combination of tools.

For this I developed a learning/content management system that provides functionality to register all the different tools.
For each tool there can be components added: eg. sliders to help e-learning through interaction.

Through authentication we make sure the different accounts can have a personlized view of only the tools that are within their department.

The application is a fork of open source project: https://bookstackapp.com with added customized functionalities.

A preview of the app can be seen on: <a href="https://guusnoij.nl/bookstack/public/" target="_blank"> LMS equipment </a>
