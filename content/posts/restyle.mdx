For my job as a UX designer, me together with other designers from the UX team helped Planon Software in their complete restyle of the software suite.
My responsibility in this project in a role of a UX designer. So no development was done within this project, although I was constantly in near contact with 
the developers who implemented the new styling. To create the new style we made use of Sketch software to build up the new component library. This component library was based on atomic
design. So larger components consisted of smaller components.

Planon Software exists of a large software suite which helps large (multinational) companies in maintaining their facilities (buildings, rooms, assets).
Below are some key points in this transition:

- Renewed modern style based on <a href="https://material.io/design" target="_blank"> Material Design </a> principles
- Light and Dark mode based on user preference over the entire software suite
- Increased visual hierarchy between elements that are used alot and that aren't used alot

Planon Software Suite exists of all different kind of apps, for example:

- Backoffice application
- Self service forms for end users
- Mobile app for service engineers
- Mobile self service app for office users
- Kiosks and roombooking panels in buildings

Challenges I faced:

- The Planon Software Suite is highly configurable and with that there come design limitations and  small design choices can have large consequences.
- Maintain the same look and feel across the whole suite because the software exists of different applications
