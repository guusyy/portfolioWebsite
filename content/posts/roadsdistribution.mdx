As a volunteer for youth orginsation "Jong Nederland Gennep" (kinda like boy scouts) we have a yearly fundraising called "Bloembollenactie".
In this fundraising all our members get assigned a street in the village to sell flower bulbs.
The assigining of streets to our members was an labour intense task because the members switched every year.
The assigning had some parameters:

- Younger kids get assigned a street as close as possible to them. For older kids it's not a problem to have a street assigned to them which they don't live in close proximity to.
- No street is assigned outside of the village, but we have members who live in smaller towns next to Gennep.
- All streets should be assigned so we cover the whole town. (there are more streets then members)

So for this I automated the tasks by creating a script which divides all streets across the members based on their adress and Open Street maps data.
For this is used some python libraries:

- Python Flask for web UI
- GeoPy
- NumPy
- Pandas

The scripts runs as follows:

- Rank orders our members based on age
- Transforms all residential addresses to coordinates
- Transforms all street data to coordinates
- Then divides all streets based upon proximity of the coordinates

Now it's just a matter of providing our member administration file as input (CSV).
The script then provides an updated administration file with the designated streets assigned to each member.
