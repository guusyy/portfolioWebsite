For an Planon innovation project I developed an interactive floorplan on which a user can select a room to perform actions on.
Planon Software has a CAD floorplan service which provides CAD drawings as SVG in applications.
In this tool I've used an example of these SVGs and tried to use this to generate a building.
This app can be used to provide a service for the user to quickly select a room on which the user needs to perform actions eg. "a service request", "make room reservation" or "report a defect".

This app is based upon <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/13/interactive-3d-mall-map/" target="_blank"> a small open source app </a>. The app makes use of CSS3 animations/transitions to rotate the svg in isometric view that changes on selection.
This provides a real fluent experience for the user to select a floor and after that a room. Because this is all done by CSS3 and SVG the performance 
of the application is kept very responsive.

The app can be seen here: <a href="http://guusnoij.nl/floorplanapp/interactivemap/planon_index.html" target="_blank"> Floorplan Application</a>
